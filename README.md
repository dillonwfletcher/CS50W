# CS50W
CS50's Web Programming with Python &amp; JavaScript

This repository contains my projects from Harvard University's CS50W. You can find the materials for the course <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" target="_blank">here</a>
or you can look at the specifications for each individual asssignment using the table of contents below.

### DISCLAIMER:
If you are currently taking the CS50W course, do not just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself. It defeats the entire purpose and is a violation of the [**Academic Honesty**](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course.
